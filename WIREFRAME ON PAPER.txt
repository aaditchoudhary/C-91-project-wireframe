1. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SCREEN NAVIGATOR IN MY APP AS IT WILL HELP THE USER SWITCH BETWEEN 
SCREENS IN NO TIME.

2. I WOULD ALSO LIKE SOME BUTTONS AS SOCIAL WORK RESULTS IN THE MAKING OF A LOT OF PETITIONS TO RESOLVE ISSUES
AND THESE BUTTONS CAN ACT AS VOTE BUTTONS. OR I CAN MAKE AN INPUT BOX WITH AN OK BUTTON WHICH CAN STORE THE
 VALUES IN THE DATABASE.
